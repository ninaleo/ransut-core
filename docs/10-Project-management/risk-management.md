# Template of Risk Management Plan

![](https://openclipart.org/image/400px/svg_to_png/163063/dontlifttoomuch.png)

List the risks, assess their severity and probability, and try to consider measures on how the most serious / probable risks could be prevented in advance. In addition, it would be good to have a plan of how to act if the risk materializes.
Attach the following section here: 

> Record the risks to the project in the table below and maintain them as needed. Each risk is given a unique identifier, eg RIS007, as this facilitates their handling in different situations.

| RISK ID |	Description | Severity | Probability | Responsible | Action in case the risk escalates | 
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| RIS01 | Team member gets the flu |  S3 | 3 |  James Pot | Inform the team leader and the client, if necessary. |
| RISKXX | [detailed description of risk, if needed]() | | | |
| RISKXX | ... |... |... |... |...|
| RISKXX |... |... |... |... |...|

**The severity class should be defined according  the project**
